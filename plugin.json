If the cursor is set to a `call` instruction the plugin detects the function's name a requests MSDN documentation.\n\nThe requested documentation is then displayed in the sidebar widget.\n\nEach documented function is also saved to a cache file named `cache.json` in the current plugin directory, meaning the plugin doesn't requests the doc for the same function everytime.\n\n## Credits\n\n- [Eric Hennenfent](https://github.com/ehennenfent) for [binja_explain_instruction](https://github.com/ehennenfent/binja_explain_instruction) which I used as templated for this plugin.\n- [Hacking Things](https://github.com/HackingThings) for the [URL I needed to make this work](https://github.com/HackingThings/binja_MSDN_Helper/blob/main/__init__.py#L17)",
